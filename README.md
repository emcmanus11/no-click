No click mouse design

How it works

Most elements on this page are clickable. However, you don't need to actually click!
To select an item, hover over it until the background color changes to red.
Then, remove your mouse pointer from the red area. The selected area will now turn blue.
Move your mouse pointer to the now blue area, and the target is selected.
Made a mistake?
Each selection state times out after 3 seconds, returning the background color of the item to it's original color and unselecting the unintended item.
As long as you don't enter the area when it's blue, you won't click a thing!
